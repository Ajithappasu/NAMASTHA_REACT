1)  // to write style css inside   js
  a) wrap it like an object in   style block 
  <div className="res-card" style={{
    backgroundColor:"black"
  }}>

  b)create a seperate css object and  keep it inside the style brackets {}.
  const jsCssObject ={
  backgroundColor:"black",
  flex:"inline"
    }
 <div className="res-card" style={jsCssObject}>
  note: this style is only valid for the div block which it is present in .

2_props: 
 these are like dynamic   parmeters passed as the object    

ex:
  <RestarentCard resName ="Paradise" cousine ="Indian"  rating ="3.0"  time ="50"/>
   // we use this in function  const { resName, cousine,  rating,time } =props;
  // we can use props.resName, directyl id needed



3) react Hooks )  nere use hooks inside an if else block or for , wihile loop ref react documentation
when ever you see a function   starting with "use" then it is Hook. 
 useState : 
       import { useState } from "react"; // we import it as named .
           // we are delcaring a state component   and set of that state component to update  the component 
    const [ listRestraunt ,setListRestraunt ]= useState(resList);
    // we are decaling the values inside  the useState ()  
    // we use this setListRestraunt to udate the component 

     setListRestraunt(filteredRestraunt);
            // onece a sate component is updated react will automaitically render every thing once again related to the component


    
    b)   useEffect(()=>{
         console.log("use effect is working ");
      fetchData();
          },[]);
          // if the dependency array is empty then it is called initialy only on first render 
          // if the dependeny array is not present then it will be called on every render 
          // if dependency array has element [btnNameReact] => called every time  when that elemet(btnNameReact) is updated   


4) Link : we use link  in the elements to shift to another route  
   because it desnot refresh the entire page it will  render  same as render object
